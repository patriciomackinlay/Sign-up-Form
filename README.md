# Sign-up-Form
The Odin Project - Sign-up Form

In this project for The Odin Project course on HTML and CSS, I'll be implementing HTML form elements to create a standard sign-up form, stylized with CSS according to a given design file.
I intend to use this project as practice for using these HTML elements and how to style them with CSS.
